,"An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.

.Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems  such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements  Others may have higher system requirements.

Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with purchased computers , whereas others may run directly from media  or flash memory ",

Disadvantages of Multiprocessor Systems
There are some disadvantages as well to multiprocessor systems. Some of these are:

Increased Expense

Even though multiprocessor systems are cheaper in the long run than using multiple computer systems, still they are quite expensive. It is much cheaper to buy a simple single processor system than a multiprocessor system.

Complicated Operating System Required

There are multiple processors in a multiprocessor system that share peripherals, memory etc. So, it is much more complicated to schedule processes and impart resources to processes.than in single processor systems. Hence, a more complex and complicated operating system is required in multiprocessor systems.

Large Main Memory Required

All the processors in the multiprocessor system share the memory. So a much larger pool of memory is required as compared to single processor systems.",

,"(1) manage the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers, (2) establish a user interface, and (3) execute and provide services for applications software.",
,"More reliable Systems

In a multiprocessor system, even if one processor fails, the system will not halt. This ability to continue working despite hardware failure is known as graceful degradation. For example: If there are 5 processors in a multiprocessor system and one of them fails, then also 4 processors are still working. So the system only becomes slower and does not ground to a halt.

Enhanced Throughput

If multiple processors are working in tandem, then the throughput of the system increases i.e. number of processes getting executed per unit of time increase. If there are N processors then the throughput increases by an amount just under N.

More Economic Systems

Multiprocessor systems are cheaper than single processor systems in the long run because they share the data storage, peripheral devices, power supplies etc. If there are multiple processes that share data, it is better to schedule them on multiprocessor systems with shared data than have different computer systems with multiple copies of the data.",

,"Following are some of important functions of an operating System.

1.Memory Management. Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word or byte has its own address
2.Processor Management In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides which process gets the processor when and for how much time. This function is called process scheduling An Operating System does the following activities for processor management âˆ’

Keeps tracks of processor and status of process. The program responsible for this task is known as traffic controller.

Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.

De-allocates processor when a process is no longer required.

3.Device Management An Operating System manages device communication via their respective drivers. It does the following activities for device management âˆ’

Keeps tracks of all devices. Program responsible for this task is known as the I/O controller.Decides which process gets the device when and for how much time

4.File Management A file system is normally organized into directories for easy navigation and usage. These directories may contain files and other directions.

5.Security âˆ’ By means of password and similar other techniques, it prevents unauthorized access to programs and data.",

,"There are multiple advantages to multiprocessor systems. Some of these are âˆ’

More reliable Systems

In a multiprocessor system, even if one processor fails, the system will not halt. This ability to continue working despite hardware failure is known as graceful degradation. For example: If there are 5 processors in a multiprocessor system and one of them fails, then also 4 processors are still working. So the system only becomes slower and does not ground to a halt.

Enhanced Throughput

If multiple processors are working in tandem, then the throughput of the system increases i.e. number of processes getting executed per unit of time increase. If there are N processors then the throughput increases by an amount just under N.

More Economic Systems

Multiprocessor systems are cheaper than single processor systems in the long run because they share the data storage, peripheral devices, power supplies etc. If there are multiple processes that share data, it is better to schedule them on multiprocessor systems with shared data than have different computer systems with multiple copies of the data.

Disadvantages of Multiprocessor Systems
There are some disadvantages as well to multiprocessor systems. Some of these are:

Increased Expense

Even though multiprocessor systems are cheaper in the long run than using multiple computer systems, still they are quite expensive. It is much cheaper to buy a simple single processor system than a multiprocessor system.

Complicated Operating System Required

There are multiple processors in a multiprocessor system that share peripherals, memory etc. So, it is much more complicated to schedule processes and impart resources to processes.than in single processor systems. Hence, a more complex and complicated operating system is required in multiprocessor systems.

Large Main Memory Required

All the processors in the multiprocessor system share the memory. So a much larger pool of memory is required as compared to single processor systems.",

A time-shared operating system uses the concept of CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared CPU.

Each user has at least one separate program in memory.

A program that is loaded into memory and is executing is commonly referred to as a process.

When a process executes, it typically executes for only a very short time before it either finishes or needs to perform I/O.

Since interactive I/O typically runs at slower speeds, it may take a long time to complete. During this time, a CPU can be utilized by another process.

The operating system allows the users to share the computer simultaneously. Since each action or command in a time-shared system tends to be short, only a little CPU time is needed for each user.

As the system switches CPU rapidly from one user/program to the next, each user is given the impression that he/she has his/her own CPU, whereas actually one CPU is being shared among many users.",

,"Multitasking operating systems (OSs) are based on the idea of time-sharing. Multitasking OSs do not actually perform multiple tasks at the same exact time. A particular central processing unit (CPU) can only do one thing at any given moment. Instead, they give the appearance of multitasking by switching back and forth between separate tasks for intervals of time too small for humans to perceive. This makes it seem to the user that multiple tasks are being carried out at once.

COOPERATION AND PREEMPTION
Multitasking OSs can take a variety of forms. One difference is the way in which they handle the context switch between different users and tasks. A multitasking OS must have some way of deciding when is the appropriate time to make a context switch. The switch requires processing resources in order to be correctly executed, and switching contexts at random would reduce the system's predictability and efficiency over time. One method of deciding the timing of context switching is cooperative multitasking. With this method, the OS will not interrupt a process with a context switch while the process is running but will instead wait for the process to finish.",

,"Multitasking is a logical extension of multi programming. But multi programming works solely on the concept of context switching whereas multitasking is based on time sharing alongside the concept of context switching

- In a time sharing system, each process is assigned some specific quantum of time for which a process is meant to execute. Say there are 4 processes P1, P2, P3, P4 ready to execute. So each of them are assigned some time quantum for which they will execute e.g time quantum of 5 nanoseconds (5 ns). As one process begins execution (say P2), it executes for that quantum of time (5 ns). After 5 ns the CPU starts the execution of the other process (say P3) for the specified quantum of time.

- Thus the CPU makes the processes to share time slices between them and execute 
   accordingly. As soon as time quantum of one process expires, another process begins its 
   execution.

- Here also basically a context switch is occurring but it is occurring so fast that the user is 
  able to interact with each program separately while it is running. This way, the user is given 
  the illusion that multiple processes/ tasks are executing simultaneously. But actually only 
  one process/ task is executing at a particular instant of time. In multitasking, time sharing 
  is best manifested because each running process takes only a fair quantum of the CPU

,"Two or more processors or CPUs present in same computer, sharing system bus, memory and I/O is called MultiProcessing System. It allows parallel execution of different processors. These systems are reliable since failure of any single processor does not affect other processors. A quad-processor system can execute four processes at a time while an octa-processor can execute eight processes at a time. The memory and other resources may be shared or distributed among processes.


A processor that has more than one core is called Multicore Processor while one with single core is called Unicore Processor or Uniprocessor. Nowadays, most of systems have four cores (Quad-core) or eight cores (Octa-core). These cores can individually read and execute program instructions, giving feel like computer system has several processors but in reality, they are cores and not processors. Instructions can be calculation, data transferring instruction, branch instruction, etc. Processor can run instructions on separate cores at same time. This increases overall speed of program execution in system. Thus heat generated by processor gets reduced and increases overall speed of execution.",
